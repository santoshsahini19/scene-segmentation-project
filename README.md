# scene-segmentation-project

In this project,
I'm implementing scene segmentation given shot features in the movie.

It's a multi modal scene segmentation (because of the given features like place, cast, action and audio). The core idea is to get the similarity between scenes in order to differentiate one scene from the other which makes it easier to detect scenes from movie data.

Technical methods include RNNs, Cosine Similarity which were supported by data pre-processing

Within the stipulated time I was able to get till here and I try to contribute more if I had more time.
